# JavaScript Testing

<!-- Practice testing my javascript applications using Jasmine. -->

'it' and 'describe' are an outline to organize the information.

'it' calls are used to define a specification (a container for a test to identify the exact feature tested). 'it' is defining the boundary around the test.  

'describe' calls are used to define a 
suite (group of related specs). Used to provide an organization tool/level of indentation. 


# Red-Green Refactor Cycle 
<!-- Put into use by writing AddressBookSpec.js application -->
	Run SpecRunner.html file for testing

# Step 1
	- Being able to add a contact
	- Write a test for it in the Spec file

# Step 2 
	- Describe a new suite and create a new spec within the suite. 
	- Represent a new addressBook object via the OOJS approach.
	- Added add contact method to my addressBook.
	- Test that 'thisContact' was added to my addressBook.
